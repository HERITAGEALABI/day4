    <p>It takes many good deeds to build a good reputation, and only one bad one to lose it.
        The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
        The only thing to do with good advice is to pass it on. 
        I can live for two months on a good compliment.
        Goodness is the only investment that never fails.
